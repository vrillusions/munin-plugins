HOW TO GET INFORMATION USED FOR NTP PLUGINS

Keep in mind that you shouldn't use awk from within a perl script.  Use awk if it can
be done in a shell script

TO GET TIME OFFSET:
  ntpq -c rv | awk 'BEGIN{FS=", "}; /offset/{print $3}'
  RETURNS: "offset=0.087"

  ntpq -c rv | awk 'BEGIN{FS=", "}; /offset/{print $3}' | awk 'BEGIN{FS="="};{print $2}'
  RETURNS: "0.087"

TO GET NUMBER OF ESTIMATED ACTIVE USERS:
  /usr/local/sbin/ntp_pool_dns | awk '{print $3}'
  RETURNS: "237"

TO GET NUMBER OF ABUSIVE USERS:
  /usr/local/sbin/ntp_pool_dns | awk '{print $4}'
  RETURNS: "5"

TO GET NUMBER OF PACKETS RECEIVED:
  ntpdc -c iostats | awk '/received packets/{ print $NF}'
  RETURNS: "11441"

TO GET NUMBER OF PACKETS SENT
  ntpdc -c iostats | awk '/packets sent/{ print $NF}'
  RETURNS: "15070"
